### The application

From the star wars api we have fetched data in order to show on my Planet Finder App. Using state variables to store the information and doing a map( ) of this data we can find a list of Star Wars planets and a few relevant details which you can view by clicking on the item. You can also find a functional search engine, were you can filter the planets by name.

The design is also responsive to desktop and mobile devices.

### Final SQL assignment

Finally, following the UML diagram below, we need to extract a list of movies from the
"ACTION" genre only. You can use the MySQL Select statement.

SELECT \* FROM movies WHERE genre = ACTION

We select ALL columns (id, title, description, detailCast) from the Movie's table and extract only the movies where the genre is ACTION.
